Today, I released the [0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/not-pure-poole/versions/0.1.0) version of a new Jekyll theme [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole) designed by me, and also, I begin to launch a new -- and hopefully permanent too -- personal blog.

Insisting to write a blog and write it good is not easy. Every time I feel frustrated I would go to read [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/) and [A. Jesse Jiryu Davis](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/)' posts to gain some power.
